        h3 What Can I Expect?
        p Do you wish to know how to analyze and solve business and economic questions with data analysis tools? Then Econometrics by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you, as you learn how to translate data into models to make forecasts and to support decision making.

        h3 Why This Course?
        p The course is suitable for (advanced undergraduate) students in economics, finance, business, engineering, and data analysis, as well as for those who work in these fields. The course requires some basics of matrices, probability, and statistics, which are reviewed in the Building Blocks module. 
        p Will there be teaching assistants active to guide me through the course?
        p We advise you to connect with fellow learners of this course to discuss topics and exercises. Staff of our Econometric Institute provides guidance in January and February of each year. In 2016, the guidance period will start at Monday January 4 and end at Friday February 26.


        h3 What Will I Learn?
        p When you know econometrics, you are able to translate data into models to make forecasts and to support decision making in a wide variety of fields, ranging from macroeconomics to finance and marketing. Our course starts with introductory lectures on simple and multiple regression, followed by topics of special interest to deal with model specification, endogenous variables, binary choice data, and time series data.  You learn these key topics in econometrics by watching the videos with in-video quizzes and by making post-video training exercises.
